About Data and Visualization {.sidebar}
======================================

The `afrobarometer_ngr` data is a publicly available data set from [**Afrobarometer**](https://www.afrobarometer.org/data/), an non-profit African survey organization based in Ghana. According to their website, they "conducts public attitude surveys on democracy, governance, the economy, and society." The data set is part of their many data sets from African countries.

Specifically, the `afrobarometer_ngr` data set is a 2022 8th round comprehensive survey on several topics from perceptions of democracy, elections and the media to attitudes towards different institutions in Nigeria. 


Trust in Institutions
=====================================  


Column {data-width=400}
-----------------------------------------

###  Nigerian Trust Religious and Traditional Leaders more

```{r, warning=FALSE}
 trust_plot
```

Column {data-width=200}
-----------------------------------------

### Trust in President by State

```{r warning=FALSE}
Trust_President_plot
```

### Trust in Religious Leaders by State

```{r warning=FALSE}
Trust_Religious_Leaders_plot
```

Issue Perceptions 
=====================================  

```{r,  include=FALSE}
