# Synopsis


-   Nigeria just concluded her general elections between February and March 15 2023

-   The current Government just concluded it's second and final term

## Goal
-   I hope to explore how Nigerians assessed a variety of issues about the outgoing government and the media     
---

## Journey

-   I never realized there's just so muc data out there about several things

-   I am glad to have taken this class as it really changed the way I think about visualizing complicated data

-   I realised there are many visualization software that I culd use to supplement and improve the plts from R (Tableau, Datawrapper e.t.c)

---

##  First Plot 

-  At first, I was having some issues with getting a map for Nigeria to plot how trust varied by different states.  
- After wrangling the data, I used Tableau to try out a map. 
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here( "final draft graphics", "Overall Trust in Institutions By State.png"))

```
---

-   After learning after the plotting spatial data for different countries from week 8 class, I was able to create a similar plot for trust in the President by state. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("final draft graphics", "trust_president.png"))

```
---
## Challenges 
-   I am still having challenges labeling the states in a way that is not distracting.
-   I got peer feedback about the color palette and the legend
-   I am still looking into implementing that in the final dashboard. 

```{r, out.width = '70%'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("final draft graphics", "map_trust.png"))
```

---
## Issue Perceptions

-     After wrangling the data, I created a simple bar plot but I realized `plot_ly` is a great way to make interactive graphs than `ggplotly`. 
-   Perhaps, I am not great at using it. 
-   The one on the left is the first one I made with `ggplot`. The one on the right is the plot_ly
-   I was also able to implement some of the class lessons on scale, colorblind friendliness and minimal use of ink to only relevant information

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, figures-side, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here( "final draft graphics", "Old issue plot.png"))

knitr::include_graphics(here( "final draft graphics", "Plotly made issues.png"))



```

## Tentative Dashbaord 

This is what my dashbaord is currently looking at but changes are still being implemented. 
gif created using `magick` package. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
imgs <- list.files(here("dashboard_image"), full.names = TRUE)
img_list <- lapply(imgs, image_read)

## join the images together
img_joined <- image_join(img_list)

## animate at 2 frames per second
img_animated <- image_animate(img_joined, fps = 1)

## view animated image
img_animated
```
